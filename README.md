## xTeVe Setup for Plex / Emby

A docker container has been created by [@taylorbourne](https://github.com/taylorbourne) / [xteve_lazystream](https://github.com/taylorbourne/xteve_lazystream) that automatically sets up xTeVe with this program to generate daily updated xmltv playlists that can be setup with Emby / Plex Live TV.
